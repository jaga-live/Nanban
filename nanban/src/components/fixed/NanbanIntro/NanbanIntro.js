            <p>My name is Nanban Connect. I am the fastest man alive. 
               One day I was stuck by lightening, and got some incredible powers.
               To the outside world I am an ordinary forensic scientist. 
               But secretly I work my friends in star labs and find other Meta-Humans lie me....
